    "Description": "If you configure a higher TTL for your records, the intermediate resolvers cache the records for longer time. As a result, there are fewer queries received by the name servers. This configuration reduces the charges corresponding to the DNS queries answered. A value between an hour (3600s) and a day (86,400s) is a common choice.",
