## Description

This control checks if a lifecycle policy is configured for an Amazon S3 bucket. This control fails if a lifecycle policy is not configured for an S3 bucket.

Configuring lifecycle rules on your S3 bucket defines actions that you want S3 to take during an object's lifetime. For example, you can transition objects to another storage class, archive them, or delete them after a specified period of time.
