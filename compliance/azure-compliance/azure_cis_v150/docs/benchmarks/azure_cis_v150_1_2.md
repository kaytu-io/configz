## Overview

For most Azure tenants, and certainly for organizations with a significant use of Azure Active Directory, Conditional Access policies are recommended and preferred. To use conditional access policies, a licensing plan is required, and Security Defaults must be disabled.

Conditional Access requires one of the following plans:

- Azure Active Directory Premium P1 or P2
- Microsoft 365 Business Premium
- Microsoft 365 E3 or E5
- Enterprise Mobility & Security E3 or E5
