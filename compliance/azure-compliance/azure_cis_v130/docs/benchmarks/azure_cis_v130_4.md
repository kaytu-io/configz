## Overview

Auditing for Azure SQL Servers and SQL Databases tracks database events and
writes them to an audit log Azure storage account, Log Analytics workspace or
Event Hubs. Auditing helps to maintain regulatory compliance, understand
database activity, and gain insight into discrepancies and anomalies that could
indicate business concerns or suspected security violations. Auditing enables
and facilitates adherence to compliance standards, although it doesn't
guarantee compliance.
