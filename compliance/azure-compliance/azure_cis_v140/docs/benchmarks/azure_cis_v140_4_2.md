## Overview

Azure Defender for SQL provides a layer of security, which enables customers to
detect and respond to potential threats as they occur by providing security
alerts on anomalous activities. Users will receive an alert upon suspicious
database activities, potential vulnerabilities, and SQL injection attacks, as
well as anomalous database access patterns. SQL Server Threat Detection alerts
provide details of suspicious activity and recommend action on how to
investigate and mitigate the threat.

Azure Defender for SQL may incur additional cost per SQL server.
