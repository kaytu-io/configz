## Overview

This section covers security recommendations that to follow to set identity and
access management policies on an Azure Subscription. Identity and Access
Management policies are the first step towards a defense-in-depth approach to
securing an Azure Cloud Platform environment.

Most of the recommendations from this section are marked as "Not Scored"
because of the lack of "Azure native CLI and API support" to perform the
respective audits. However, from a security posture standpoint, these
recommendations are important. According to the last communication with the
Microsoft Support team regarding "Azure native CLI and API support", Microsoft
teams are working to enhance "Microsoft graph API" to support all these "Azure
AD" functionalities. Once we get this capability through "Microsoft Graph API",
we will update the involved recommendations with the respective audit and
remediation steps to make them as scored.
