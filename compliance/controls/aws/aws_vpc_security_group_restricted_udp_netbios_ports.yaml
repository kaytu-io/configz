Title: Security groups should not allow unrestricted access to UDP NetBIOS ports
Description: This control checks whether unrestricted incoming traffic for the security groups is accessible to the UDP NetBIOS ports. This control passes when none of the rules in a security group allow ingress traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 for those ports.
