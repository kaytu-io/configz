Title: Ensure that Object-level logging for write events is enabled for S3 bucket
Description: S3 object-level API operations such as GetObject, DeleteObject, and PutObject are called data events. By default, CloudTrail trails don't log data events and so it is recommended to enable Object-level logging for S3 buckets.
