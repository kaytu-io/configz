      "The cost of non-compliance to this AWS control can be associated to both financial and security risks. Here are some areas to consider:\n\n1. **Security Risk:** Unused credentials, particularly access keys, pose a potential security risk. If these credentials are compromised, they provide an entry point for unauthorized users to the AWS resources. Regularly auditing and removing unused credentials reduces this risk.\n\n2. **Financial Costs:** If compromised, these stale credentials can lead to unwanted access to AWS services that could increase the AWS costs. This could come in the form of data theft, data transfers or operation of AWS resources without your knowledge.\n\n3. **Non-compliance with Regulations and Standards:** Failure to periodically review and remove unused credentials may result in non-compliance with regulations like the GDPR, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, or other cybersecurity standards, which could lead to penalties and damage to a company's reputation.\n\nIn summary, maintaining unused credentials increases the attack surface for potential bad actors, which could result in financial losses, a damaged reputation due to a data breach, as well as penalties for non-compliance with regulations and standards."

    "x-kaytu-usefulness-example": [
      "The recommended control of deactivating or removing unused AWS credentials after 45 days can be beneficial in the following scenario:\n\nConsider a large software development company that heavily relies on AWS for diverse tasks such as hosting web applications, data storage, machine learning tasks, etc. It is common for such an organization to have multiple IAM users with various types of credentials like passwords or access keys for accessing different AWS resources.\n\nOver time, some IAM users might not remain active due to reasons like a change in job role, employees leaving the organization, or simply the completion of certain projects. If such inactive users have access to sensitive resources, it poses security risks since the unused credentials can potentially be exploited for unauthorized access to AWS resources.\n\nThis is where our control comes into play. By deactivating or removing IAM credentials that haven't been used for 45 or more days, the company can significantly minimize the potential security risks. It helps the company to maintain only the necessary access keys and reduce the possibility of outdated credentials being misused. \n\nFollowing this practice also helps the company to stay compliant with regulatory requirements and adhere to the principle of least privilege (only giving necessary access required for a user to perform his/her job), enhancing the overall security posture of their AWS environment.\n"
