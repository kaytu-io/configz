Description: Deploy Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of public facing
  web applications for additional inspection of incoming traffic. Web Application
  Firewall (WAF) provides centralized protection of your web applications from common
  exploits and vulnerabilities such as SQL injections, Cross-Site Scripting, local
  and remote file executions. You can also restrict access to your web applications
  by countries, IP address ranges, and other http(s) parameters via custom rules.
