Title: Cognitive Services accounts should disable public network access
Description: To improve the security of Cognitive Services accounts, ensure that it isn't exposed to the public internet and can only be accessed from a private endpoint. Disable the public network access property as described in https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2129800. This option disables access from any public address space outside the Azure IP range, and denies all logins that match IP or virtual network-based firewall rules. This reduces data leakage risks.
