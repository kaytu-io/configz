Description: Azure Database for PostgreSQL supports connecting your Azure Database
  for PostgreSQL server to client applications using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Enforcing
  SSL connections between your database server and your client applications helps
  protect against 'man in the middle' attacks by encrypting the data stream between
  the server and your application. This configuration enforces that SSL is always
  enabled for accessing your database server.
