Description: Use encryption at host to get end-to-end encryption for your virtual
  machine and virtual machine scale set data. Encryption at host enables encryption
  at rest for your temporary disk and OS/data disk caches. Temporary and ephemeral
  OS disks are encrypted with platform-managed keys when encryption at host is enabled.
  OS/data disk caches are encrypted at rest with either customer-managed or platform-managed
  key, depending on the encryption type selected on the disk. Learn more at https://aka.ms/vm-hbe.
