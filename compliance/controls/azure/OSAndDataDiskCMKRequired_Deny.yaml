Description: Use customer-managed keys to manage the encryption at rest of the contents
  of your managed disks. By default, the data is encrypted at rest with platform-managed
  keys, but customer-managed keys are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance
  standards. Customer-managed keys enable the data to be encrypted with an Azure Key
  Vault key created and owned by you. You have full control and responsibility for
  the key lifecycle, including rotation and management. Learn more at https://aka.ms/disks-cmk.
