Description: Use a customer-managed key to control the encryption at rest of the data
  stored in Azure API for FHIR when this is a regulatory or compliance requirement.
  Customer-managed keys also deliver double encryption by adding a second layer of
  encryption on top of the default one done with service-managed keys.
