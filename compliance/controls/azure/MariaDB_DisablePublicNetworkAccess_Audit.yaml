Description: Disable the public network access property to improve security and ensure
  your Azure Database for MariaDB can only be accessed from a private endpoint. This
  configuration strictly disables access from any public address space outside of
  Azure IP range, and denies all logins that match IP or virtual network-based firewall
  rules.
