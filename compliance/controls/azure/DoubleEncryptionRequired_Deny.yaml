Description: High security sensitive customers who are concerned of the risk associated
  with any particular encryption algorithm, implementation, or key being compromised
  can opt for additional layer of encryption using a different encryption algorithm/mode
  at the infrastructure layer using platform managed encryption keys. The disk encryption
  sets are required to use double encryption. Learn more at https://aka.ms/disks-doubleEncryption.
