  "Title": "Virtual machines should encrypt temp disks, caches, and data flows between Compute and Storage resources",
  "Description": "By default, a virtual machine's OS and data disks are encrypted-at-rest using platform-managed keys. Temp disks, data caches and data flowing between compute and storage aren't encrypted. Disregard this recommendation if: 1. using encryption-at-host, or 2. server-side encryption on Managed Disks meets your security requirements.
