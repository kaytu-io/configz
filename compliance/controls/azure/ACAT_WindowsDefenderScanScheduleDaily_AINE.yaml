Description: To ensure prompt detection of malware and minimize its impact on your
  system, it is recommended that Windows machines with Windows Defender schedule a
  daily scan. Please make sure Windows Defender is supported, preinstalled on the
  device, and Guest Configuration prerequisites are deployed. Failure to meet these
  requirements may lead to inaccurate evaluation results. Learn more about Guest Configuration
