Description: 'By default, a virtual machine''s OS and data disks are encrypted-at-rest
  using platform-managed keys. Temp disks, data caches and data flowing between compute
  and storage aren''t encrypted. Disregard this recommendation if: 1. using encryption-at-host,
  or 2. server-side encryption on Managed Disks meets your security requirements.
