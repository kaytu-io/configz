Description: Network security groups should be periodically evaluated for port misconfigurations. Where certain ports and protocols may be exposed to the Internet, they should be evaluated for necessity and restricted wherever they are not explicitly required and narrowly configured.

  - "# Azure Control: Network Security Group (NSG) Evaluation\n\n## Description:\nPeriodically evaluate Network Security Groups (NSGs) for port misconfigurations. Identify instances where certain ports and protocols are exposed to the Internet. Evaluate the necessity of these exposures and restrict them where not explicitly required. Ensure that configurations are narrowly defined.\n"

    Non-compliance with the Azure Control for Network Security Group (NSG) Evaluation can result in various costs, including:

    Security Risks:

    Exposure of unnecessary ports and protocols to the Internet increases the risk of unauthorized access and potential security breaches.
    Data Breach Consequences:

    Misconfigurations may lead to data breaches, compromising sensitive information and causing reputational damage.
    Regulatory Penalties:

    Failure to adhere to security best practices may result in regulatory non-compliance, leading to financial penalties.
    Operational Disruptions:

    Inadequate port restrictions can result in operational disruptions, affecting the availability and reliability of services.
  x-kaytu-usefulness-example:
  - |-
    Consider a scenario where an organization implements the Azure Control for NSG Evaluation:

    Usefulness Scenario:

    An organization periodically reviews its NSGs and identifies that a particular server has unnecessary ports open to the Internet. After evaluation, it is determined that these ports are not explicitly required for the server's functionality. The organization then restricts access to these ports, reducing the attack surface and enhancing overall network security.

    In this instance, the Azure Control proves useful by proactively preventing potential security vulnerabilities and ensuring that network configurations align with business requirements.
