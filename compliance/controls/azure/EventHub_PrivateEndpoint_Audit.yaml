Description: 'Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual network to Azure services
  without a public IP address at the source or destination. The Private Link platform
  handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone
  network. By mapping private endpoints to Event Hub namespaces, data leakage risks
  are reduced. Learn more at: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/private-link-service.'
