Title: "[Deprecated]: App Service apps should have 'Client Certificates (Incoming client certificates)' enabled"
Description: Client certificates allow for the app to request a certificate for incoming requests. Only clients that have a valid certificate will be able to reach the app. This policy has been replaced by a new policy with the same name because Http 2.0 doesn't support client certificates.
