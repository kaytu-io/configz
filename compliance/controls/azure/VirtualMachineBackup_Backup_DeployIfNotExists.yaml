Description: Enforce backup for all virtual machines by backing them up to an existing
  central recovery services vault in the same location and subscription as the virtual
  machine. Doing this is useful when there is a central team in your organization
  managing backups for all resources in a subscription. You can optionally exclude
  virtual machines containing a specified tag to control the scope of assignment.
