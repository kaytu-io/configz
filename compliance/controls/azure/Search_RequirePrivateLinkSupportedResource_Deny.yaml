Description: 'With supported SKUs of Azure Cognitive Search, Azure Private Link lets
  you connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at
  the source or destination. The private link platform handles the connectivity between
  the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints
  to your Search service, data leakage risks are reduced. Learn more at: https://aka.ms/azure-cognitive-search/inbound-private-endpoints.'
