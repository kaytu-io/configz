Description: Manage encryption at rest of Azure HPC Cache with customer-managed keys.
  By default, customer data is encrypted with service-managed keys, but customer-managed
  keys are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance standards. Customer-managed
  keys enable the data to be encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key created and owned
  by you. You have full control and responsibility for the key lifecycle, including
  rotation and management.
