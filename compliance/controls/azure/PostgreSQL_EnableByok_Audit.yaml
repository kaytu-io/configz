Description: Use customer-managed keys to manage the encryption at rest of your PostgreSQL
  servers. By default, the data is encrypted at rest with service-managed keys, but
  customer-managed keys are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance standards.
  Customer-managed keys enable the data to be encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key
  created and owned by you. You have full control and responsibility for the key lifecycle,
  including rotation and management.
