    Imagine a scenario where a malicious actor attempts to exfiltrate sensitive data from your organization by exploiting DNS vulnerabilities. Microsoft Defender for DNS, by scanning all network traffic exiting from within a subscription, can detect and prevent such unauthorized data transfers. This ensures the security and integrity of your network, safeguarding against potential data breaches and unauthorized access.
