Description: 'Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual networks to Azure services
  without a public IP address at the source or destination. The private link platform
  handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone
  network. By mapping private endpoints to your Azure Web PubSub Service, you can
  reduce data leakage risks. Learn more about private links at: https://aka.ms/awps/privatelink.'
