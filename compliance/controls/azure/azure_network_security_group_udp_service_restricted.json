      "### Azure Control: Disable Internet exposed UDP ports on network security groups\n\n#### Description:\nThis Azure Control focuses on enhancing security by preventing Internet exposure of UDP ports within network security groups (NSGs).\n\n#### Implementation Steps:\n1. Identify the network security group associated with the target resources.\n2. Review existing inbound and outbound rules for UDP ports.\n3. Disable Internet-exposed UDP ports by updating NSG rules.\n4. Validate the changes to ensure desired security posture.\n\n#### Rationale:\nBy restricting UDP port exposure to the Internet, this control helps mitigate potential security risks, unauthorized access, and malicious activities.\n\n#### Compliance Status:\nCheck and ensure that all NSGs align with the configured rules to comply with this control.\n\n"

      "Non-compliance with this Azure Control can result in several potential costs:\n\nSecurity Risks:\n\nExposure of UDP ports to the Internet increases the risk of unauthorized access and potential security breaches.\nData Breach Consequences:\n\nFailure to disable Internet-exposed UDP ports may lead to data breaches, compromising sensitive information.\nRegulatory Penalties:\n\nNon-compliance with security controls, especially related to network exposure, may result in regulatory penalties.\nOperational Disruptions:\n\nSecurity incidents due to open UDP ports can lead to operational disruptions, downtime, and additional remediation efforts.\nReputation Damage:\n\nA security incident resulting from non-compliance can harm the organization's reputation, eroding customer trust.\nLegal Consequences:\n\nLegal actions may be taken against the organization for failing to adhere to security standards and protect user data."

    "x-kaytu-usefulness-example": [
      "Consider a scenario where an organization hosts a web application on Azure that communicates with a backend server using UDP. The organization follows the Azure Control to disable Internet-exposed UDP ports on network security groups.\n\nUsefulness Scenario:\n\nScenario Description:\n\nThe web application uses UDP for efficient communication with the backend server.\nInitially, UDP ports were open to the Internet, allowing potential exposure.\nImplementation of Azure Control:\n\nThe organization identifies the UDP ports used for communication.\nNetwork security groups associated with the application are updated to disable Internet exposure for these UDP ports.\nResult:\n\nBy implementing the control, the organization ensures that UDP ports are only accessible within the intended network.\nThis prevents unauthorized access, reducing the risk of malicious activities targeting the application.\nBenefits:\n\nEnhanced security for the web application.\nMitigation of potential threats associated with Internet-exposed UDP ports.\nCompliance with best practices for network security in Azure.\nThis example illustrates how implementing the Azure Control contributes to the overall security posture of the organization's Azure environment."
