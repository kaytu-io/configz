Description: Creating a private endpoint for the indicated Storage Sync Service resource
  allows you to address your Storage Sync Service resource from within the private
  IP address space of your organization's network, rather than through the internet-accessible
  public endpoint. Creating a private endpoint by itself does not disable the public
  endpoint.
