Description: 'To secure the data at rest on the device, ensure it''s double-encrypted,
  the access to data is controlled, and once the device is deactivated, the data is
  securely erased off the data disks. Double encryption is the use of two layers of
  encryption: BitLocker XTS-AES 256-bit encryption on the data volumes and built-in
  encryption of the hard drives. Learn more in the security overview documentation
  for the specific Stack Edge device.'
