Title: Storage account encryption scopes should use customer-managed keys to encrypt data at rest
Description: Use customer-managed keys to manage the encryption at rest of your storage account encryption scopes. Customer-managed keys enable the data to be encrypted with an Azure key-vault key created and owned by you. You have full control and responsibility for the key lifecycle, including rotation and management. Learn more about storage account encryption scopes at https://aka.ms/encryption-scopes-overview.
