Description: Azure Service Bus supports the option of encrypting data at rest with
  either Microsoft-managed keys (default) or customer-managed keys. Choosing to encrypt
  data using customer-managed keys enables you to assign, rotate, disable, and revoke
  access to the keys that Service Bus will use to encrypt data in your namespace.
  Note that Service Bus only supports encryption with customer-managed keys for premium
  namespaces.
