Description: Periodically, newer versions are released for PHP software either due
  to security flaws or to include additional functionality. Using the latest PHP version
  for App Service apps is recommended in order to take advantage of security fixes,
  if any, and/or new functionalities of the latest version. This policy only applies
  to Linux apps. This policy requires you to specify a PHP version that meets your
  requirements.
