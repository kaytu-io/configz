Description: Malicious deletion of an Azure Key Vault Managed HSM can lead to permanent
  data loss. A malicious insider in your organization can potentially delete and purge
  Azure Key Vault Managed HSM. Purge protection protects you from insider attacks
  by enforcing a mandatory retention period for soft deleted Azure Key Vault Managed
  HSM. No one inside your organization or Microsoft will be able to purge your Azure
  Key Vault Managed HSM during the soft delete retention period.
