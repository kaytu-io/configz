Description: Azure Virtual Network deployment provides enhanced security, isolation
  and allows you to place your API Management service in a non-internet routable network
  that you control access to. These networks can then be connected to your on-premises
  networks using various VPN technologies, which enables access to your backend services
  within the network and/or on-premises. The developer portal and API gateway, can
  be configured to be accessible either from the Internet or only within the virtual
  network.
