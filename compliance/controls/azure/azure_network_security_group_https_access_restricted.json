Identify instances where certain ports and protocols are exposed to the Internet. Evaluate the necessity of these exposures and restrict them where not explicitly required. Ensure that configurations are narrowly defined.\n"

      "Non-compliance with the Azure Control for Network Security Group (NSG) Evaluation can result in various costs, including:\n\nSecurity Risks:\n\nExposure of unnecessary ports and protocols to the Internet increases the risk of unauthorized access and potential security breaches.\nData Breach Consequences:\n\nMisconfigurations may lead to data breaches, compromising sensitive information and causing reputational damage.\nRegulatory Penalties:\n\nFailure to adhere to security best practices may result in regulatory non-compliance, leading to financial penalties.\nOperational Disruptions:\n\nInadequate port restrictions can result in operational disruptions, affecting the availability and reliability of services."

    "x-kaytu-usefulness-example": [
      "Consider a scenario where an organization implements the Azure Control for NSG Evaluation:\n\nUsefulness Scenario:\n\nAn organization periodically reviews its NSGs and identifies that a particular server has unnecessary ports open to the Internet. After evaluation, it is determined that these ports are not explicitly required for the server's functionality. The organization then restricts access to these ports, reducing the attack surface and enhancing overall network security.\n\nIn this instance, the Azure Control proves useful by proactively preventing potential security vulnerabilities and ensuring that network configurations align with business requirements."
