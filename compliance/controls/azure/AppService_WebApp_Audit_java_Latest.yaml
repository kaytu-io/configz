Title: App Service apps that use Java should use a specified 'Java version'
Description: Periodically, newer versions are released for Java software either due to security flaws or to include additional functionality. Using the latest Java version for App Service apps is recommended in order to take advantage of security fixes, if any, and/or new functionalities of the latest version. This policy only applies to Linux apps. This policy requires you to specify a Java version that meets your requirements.
