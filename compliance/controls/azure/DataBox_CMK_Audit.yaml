Description: Use a customer-managed key to control the encryption of the device unlock
  password for Azure Data Box. Customer-managed keys also help manage access to the
  device unlock password by the Data Box service in order to prepare the device and
  copy data in an automated manner. The data on the device itself is already encrypted
  at rest with Advanced Encryption Standard 256-bit encryption, and the device unlock
  password is encrypted by default with a Microsoft managed key.
