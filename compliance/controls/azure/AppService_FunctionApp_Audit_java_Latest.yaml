Description: Periodically, newer versions are released for Java software either due
  to security flaws or to include additional functionality. Using the latest Java
  version for Function apps is recommended in order to take advantage of security
  fixes, if any, and/or new functionalities of the latest version. This policy only
  applies to Linux apps. This policy requires you to specify a Java version that meets
  your requirements.
