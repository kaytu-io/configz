Description: Audit requirement of Secure transfer in your storage account. Secure
  transfer is an option that forces your storage account to accept requests only from
  secure connections (HTTPS). Use of HTTPS ensures authentication between the server
  and the service and protects data in transit from network layer attacks such as
  man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, and session-hijacking
