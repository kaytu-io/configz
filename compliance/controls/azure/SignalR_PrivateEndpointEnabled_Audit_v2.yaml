Description: 'Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual network to Azure services
  without a public IP address at the source or destination. The private link platform
  handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone
  network. By mapping private endpoints to your Azure SignalR Service resource instead
  of the entire service, you''ll reduce your data leakage risks. Learn more about
  private links at: https://aka.ms/asrs/privatelink.'
