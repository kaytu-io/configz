Title: "[Deprecated]: Function apps should have 'Client Certificates (Incoming client certificates)' enabled"
Description: Client certificates allow for the app to request a certificate for incoming requests. Only clients with valid certificates will be able to reach the app. This policy has been replaced by a new policy with the same name because Http 2.0 doesn't support client certificates.
