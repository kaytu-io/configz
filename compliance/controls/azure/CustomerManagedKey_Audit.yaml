Description: Customer-managed keys are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance
  standards. Customer-managed keys enable the data stored in Cognitive Services to
  be encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key created and owned by you. You have full
  control and responsibility for the key lifecycle, including rotation and management.
