Description: Use customer-managed keys to manage the encryption at rest of your Azure
  HDInsight clusters. By default, customer data is encrypted with service-managed
  keys, but customer-managed keys are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance
  standards. Customer-managed keys enable the data to be encrypted with an Azure Key
  Vault key created and owned by you. You have full control and responsibility for
  the key lifecycle, including rotation and management. Learn more at https://aka.ms/hdi.cmk.
