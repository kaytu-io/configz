Description: Azure Virtual Networks provide enhanced security and isolation for your
  Azure Machine Learning Compute Clusters and Instances, as well as subnets, access
  control policies, and other features to further restrict access. When a compute
  is configured with a virtual network, it is not publicly addressable and can only
  be accessed from virtual machines and applications within the virtual network.
